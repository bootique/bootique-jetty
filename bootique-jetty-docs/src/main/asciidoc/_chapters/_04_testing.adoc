== Testing Jetty Services

NOTE: "bootique-jetty" provides integration for JUnit 5. You can still test Jetty apps using JUnit 4 with
generic Bootique test tools (`BQTestFactory`), however this would require a bit more setup, and doesn't provide
all the cool features like dynamic ports and response assertions.

To use "bootique-jetty" test extensions, import the following module in the "test" scope:

.Maven
[%collapsible%open]
====
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.bootique.jetty</groupId>
    <artifactId>bootique-jetty-junit5</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----
====

.Gradle
[%collapsible]
====
[source,groovy]
----
{
  testImplementation: 'io.bootique.jetty:bootique-jetty-junit5:test'
}
----
====

Most Jetty tests start like this:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../test/java/io/bootique/jetty/docs/JettyIT.java[tags=declarations]
----
<1> `JettyTester` doesn't require lifecycle annotations. All you need is one instance per BQRuntime. Declaring it as a
test class variable, so that both the runtime and the test code can access it per examples below.
<2> `JettyTester` helps to bootstrap a test BQRuntime. It resets all connectors configured in the app,
and creates a connector on a randomly selected unoccupied port.

NOTE: Not hardcoding the connector port improves your chances of tests working regardless of
what else is running on the same machine. Also it may reduce the amount of test configuration (previously
it was common to create a test `.yml` file that would define a specific Jetty port). Bootique uses the dynamic port
approach in other test helpers too.

An actual test looks as follows:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../test/java/io/bootique/jetty/docs/JettyIT.java[tags=test]
----
<1> Web requests are sent using JAX-RS HTTP client API. JettyHelper provides access to the client "target", so we don't
need to know about the dynamic port or service host name.
<2> JettyHelper provides a simple DSL for response assertions.
