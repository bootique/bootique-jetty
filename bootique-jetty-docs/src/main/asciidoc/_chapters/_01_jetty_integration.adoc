== Bootique Integration with Jetty

https://github.com/bootique/bootique-jetty[`bootique-jetty`] module embeds http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/[Jetty web
server] in your application. It provides environment for running servlet specification objects (servlets, servlet
filters, servlet listeners). Also you will be able to serve static files that are either packaged in the application
jar or located somewhere on the filesystem. As things go with Bootique, you will be able to centrally configure both
Jetty (e.g. set connector ports) and your apps (e.g. map servlet URL patterns and pass servlet parameters).

`bootique-jetty` is "drag-and-drop" just like any other Bootique module. It is enabled by simply adding it to the
`pom.xml` dependencies (assuming `autoLoadModules()` is in effect):

.Maven
[%collapsible%open]
====
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.bootique.jetty</groupId>
    <artifactId>bootique-jetty</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
====

.Gradle
[%collapsible]
====
[source,groovy]
----
{
  implementation: 'io.bootique.jetty:bootique-jetty'
}
----
====

Alternatively you may include an <<merics-and-healthchecks,"instrumented" version>> of `bootique-jetty` that will
enable a number of metrics for your running app. Either the regular or the instrumented Jetty modules provide `--server`
command, which starts your web server on foreground:

----
java -jar my.jar --server
...
i.b.j.s.ServerFactory - Adding listener i.b.j.s.DefaultServletEnvironment
i.b.j.s.h.ContextHandler - Started o.e.j.s.ServletContextHandler@1e78c66e{/myapp,null,AVAILABLE}
i.b.j.s.ServerConnector - Started ServerConnector@41ccbaa{HTTP/1.1,[http/1.1]}{0.0.0.0:8080}
i.b.j.s.Server - Started @490ms
----

Various aspects of the Jetty container, such as listen port, thread pool size, etc. can be configured in a normal
Bootique way via YAML, as detailed in the <<jetty-configuration,"Configuration Reference" chapter>>. A few
additional Bootique modules that extend Jetty to support CORS, websockets, etc. are documented in the
<<jetty-extensions,"Extensions" chapter>>.
